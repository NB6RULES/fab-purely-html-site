<h2>Nadec Biju</h2>
<p>I am Nadec Biju, a Mechanical Engineering undergraduate at the School of Engineering, CUSAT, with a strong interest in digital fabrication, robotics, CAD systems, and product development. I enjoy working at the intersection of hardware and software — designing mechanical systems, building prototypes, and developing tools that turn ideas into real, functional products.
I have experience working with CAD modeling, parametric design, embedded systems, and rapid prototyping using 3D printing and CNC processes. As part of student motorsports and engineering teams, I have contributed to vehicle design, manufacturing, testing, and project management.
Through Fab Academy, I aim to strengthen my skills in digital manufacturing, electronics, and full-stack product development, while building practical solutions to real-world engineering problems. </p>
<h2>PROJECTS</h2>
<h3> 6-DOF Robotic Arm Design and Development </h3>
    <p>Designed and built a six-degree-of-freedom robotic arm for pick-and-place and automation experiments. The project involved mechanical design, motor selection, encoder integration, kinematic analysis, and control system development.</p>
<h3> 2. Baja Vehicle Design – Tarusa Motorsports </h3>
    <p>Served as Team Captain and design contributor for Tarusa Motorsports, working on chassis layout, suspension geometry, drivetrain packaging, and manufacturability for a student Baja competition vehicle.</p>
<h3> 3. 3D Printing & Rapid Prototyping Service Platform</h3>
    <p>Developing an online platform to offer 3D printing services, CAD design, and reverse engineering solutions. Responsible for workflow planning, service design, and manufacturing process optimization.</p>

<h2>Educational Background</h2>
<h3> Bachelor of Technology in Mechanical Engineering </h3>
